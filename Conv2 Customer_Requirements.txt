The customer requirements for Car A from Conv2: 


Customer: Good afternoon. I'm looking for a car within a budget of Rs. 600,000. My primary concerns are safety and proper maintenance. I don't have any specific preference for the vehicle size or type.
Customer: I don't have a preference for that either. Just show me what fits my budget and requirements.
Customer: That's good to know. What kind of warranty do you offer after purchase?
Customer: That sounds reassuring. So, what options do you have in my budget?
Customer: I see. Can you show me a sedan? I prefer something at least the size of a Fabia.
Customer: How much is it?
Customer: Hmm, the scratches and paint job are a bit concerning. Do you have anything else?
Customer: What about the engine and overall maintenance?
Customer: That's good to hear. What about the resale value after three years?
Customer: That sounds fair. Can I take a test drive?
Customer: I live about five kilometers from here. Can we arrange a home test drive?
Customer: Thank you. I appreciate your help.
Customer: Thank you. Goodbye.
